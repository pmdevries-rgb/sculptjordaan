                Strength training isn&apos;t just for men. It&apos;s the most underrated investment in
                women&apos;s health. Stronger bones, better posture, more energy, and a body that
                stays functionally fit well into old age. Yet many women still stick to cardio
                only. Time to change that.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why strength training matters especially for women</h2>
              <p>
                After thirty, women lose an average of 3-5% of muscle mass per decade. After
                menopause, this accelerates. Strength training reverses this process. The
                benefits go far beyond building muscle:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Bone density:</strong> Strength training stimulates bone growth and reduces osteoporosis risk</li>
                <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> More muscle mass means a higher resting metabolic rate, even on the sofa</li>
                <li><strong>Posture:</strong> Strong back and shoulder muscles correct a sedentary work posture</li>
                <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Strength training reduces stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms</li>
                <li><strong>Functional strength:</strong> Carrying groceries, climbing stairs, lifting children — everything becomes easier</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">&quot;Won&apos;t I get too bulky?&quot;</h2>
              <p>
                No. Women produce a fraction of the testosterone that men have. The images of
                extremely muscular women you see online are the result of years of highly
                specific training, strict nutrition, and sometimes supplements. Normal strength
                training gives you a toned, strong body — not a bodybuilder silhouette. Your
                trainer adjusts your programme to your goals.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Private training: no stares, no discomfort</h2>
              <p>
                Many women feel uncomfortable in the weights section of a large gym. The male
                dominance, the stares, the feeling of being watched. At SculptClub you train
                in a <a href="/en/studio" className="text-brand hover:underline">private
                studio</a> — just you and your trainer. You receive your door code via WhatsApp
                the evening before. No reception, no waiting, no audience.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">A programme tailored to you</h2>
              <p>
                No standard template. Your trainer creates a programme based on your goals,
                experience and available time. Whether you want to lose weight, get stronger,
                or simply feel fitter — the plan fits you. Every few weeks your trainer
                evaluates progress and adjusts.
              </p>
              <p>
