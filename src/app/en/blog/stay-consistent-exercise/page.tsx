                You know how it goes: you start working out full of enthusiasm, but after a few weeks the motivation
                fades. You skip one session, then another, and before you know it your gym visits are a thing of the
                past. You are not alone. Research shows that nearly half of all new exercisers quit within six months.
                The good news? With the right approach, you can turn exercise into a lasting habit. Here are seven
                proven tips.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">1. Make it easy to start</h2>
              <p>
                The biggest barrier is often getting to the gym in the first place. The more obstacles you have to
                overcome, the quicker you drop off. Choose a studio close to your home or work. Lay out your workout
                clothes the night before. And pick a gym where you can get in quickly, without fuss over keycards or
                waiting in line. At SculptClub, you receive a door code via WhatsApp the evening before, so you can
                walk in at your own pace.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">2. Schedule fixed times in your calendar</h2>
              <p>
                Treat your workout like an appointment you do not cancel. Block two to three fixed slots per week in
                your calendar. After a few weeks, it becomes second nature. It does not matter which days you choose,
                as long as you stay consistent. Morning, afternoon or evening: pick the time that fits your life best.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">3. Start small and build gradually</h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest mistakes is being too ambitious at the start. Working out five times a week sounds
                great, but it is unsustainable for most beginners. Start with two sessions per week of 45 minutes
                instead. If that goes well for three weeks, consider adding a third session. Progress should be
                gradual, otherwise you risk injury or burnout.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">4. Find a type of training you enjoy</h2>
              <p>
                There is no point in forcing yourself to run if you hate running. Try different training styles until
                you find something that suits you. Strength training, functional training, boxing or a combination:
                if you enjoy it, you will not need to motivate yourself. During a free intro session, you can
                discover together with a trainer which style works best for you.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">5. Choose an environment without barriers</h2>
              <p>
                A crowded gym where you have to wait for equipment is demotivating. Many people quit precisely because
                the atmosphere is intimidating or it is too busy. A private studio like SculptClub offers a calm
                environment where you can train at your own pace. No waiting, no crowds, no awkward stares. And the
                best part? No contract or long cancellation period. You can always cancel for free, so you are never
                locked in.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">6. Track your progress</h2>
              <p>
                Seeing results is one of the most powerful motivators. Track what you train, how much weight you use
                and how you feel after each session. After a few weeks, you can look back and see how far you have
                come. This can be as simple as a notebook or an app on your phone. The small improvements you make
                each week add up to big results.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">7. Invest in guidance</h2>
              <p>
                A personal trainer is not just for elite athletes. Especially as a beginner, a good trainer makes the
                difference between quitting and sticking with it. A trainer holds you accountable, adjusts your
                program when needed and ensures you train with proper form. At SculptClub, you can book personal
                training from just €45 per session, or train independently via Open Gym.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Consistency is not about perfection</h2>
              <p>
                Everyone misses a workout sometimes. That is normal and not the end of the world. Consistency does not
                mean you never skip a day, it means you always get back on track. The perfect week does not exist.
                What does exist is a routine that fits your life, an environment that supports you, and an approach
                that is realistic. Start building that today.
