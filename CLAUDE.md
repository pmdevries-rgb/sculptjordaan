## Key Patterns
- All pages use `PageLayout`, `Section`, `SectionHeader`, `FadeIn` components

- Booking links in `src/config/acuity.ts`

- Fonts: Syne (headings) + Instrument Sans (body)

## Legacy WordPress Repo
- **Repo:** github.com/pmdevries-rgb/sculptclub-site (archived)
- Contains PHP snippets, JS runtime, and WordPress themes from before the Next.js migration
- All business logic has been migrated to this repo — the WordPress repo is reference only
- Do NOT build new features there

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Never use "€49" or "€60" for PT starting price — it's **€45**
- Never mention cancellation time limits — cancellation is **always free**
- Never say door code comes by email — it comes **via WhatsApp the night before**
- Never list iDEAL as a standalone payment method
- Never use "sculptjordaan" or "Sculpt Jordaan" as the business name — it's **SculptClub**
- Never add light mode — dark theme only is intentional for brand
- Always create both NL and EN versions of any new page or blog post
