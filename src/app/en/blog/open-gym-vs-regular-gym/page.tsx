                If you are looking for a place to train in Amsterdam, you have more options than ever. Beyond the well-known
                gym chains, there are an increasing number of boutique concepts, including Open Gym. But what exactly is the
                difference? And which option best suits your training style? In this article, we compare Open Gym with a
                traditional gym on all the important points.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What is Open Gym?</h2>
              <p>
                Open Gym is a concept where you train independently in a private or semi-private studio. You book a time
                slot of usually 60 minutes and during that time have access to professional equipment, without having to
                share the space with dozens of other people. At SculptClub, there are a maximum of 3 people in the studio
                at any time.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The key differences</h2>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Privacy and crowding</h3>
              <p>
                The biggest difference is privacy. In a regular gym, you share the space with sometimes dozens to hundreds
                of people. Waiting for equipment, unwanted stares, and background noise are a daily reality. With Open Gym,
                you train in a quiet environment with just a handful of people at most. Perfect if you want to focus on your
                training without distractions.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Cost</h3>
              <p>
                A budget gym typically starts at around 20 to 30 euros per month, but you also get a budget experience. A
                mid-range gym easily costs 40 to 60 euros per month. Open Gym at SculptClub starts from 29 euros per 4 weeks
                for 2 sessions per week, which is comparable to a mid-range gym. The difference? You get a premium experience
                for a similar price.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Equipment</h3>
              <p>
                Large gyms often have lots of equipment, but it is spread across a huge space and frequently occupied by
                other members. With Open Gym, all the equipment you need for a complete strength workout is available and
                always free. Think power racks, cable machines, dumbbells, benches, and accessories.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Flexibility</h3>
              <p>
                At a gym, you usually have a monthly or annual contract. With Open Gym, you often work with a flexible
                system without long-term commitments. At SculptClub, we use 4-week cycles that you can cancel at any time.
                No lock-in anxiety, no fine print.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Who is Open Gym right for?</h2>
              <p>
                Open Gym is ideal for people who:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Can train independently and know what they are doing</li>
                <li>Value privacy and calm during their workout</li>
                <li>Do not want a long-term membership commitment</li>
                <li>Live or work in the Jordaan and want to train nearby</li>
                <li>Prefer training in a clean, well-maintained space</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Who is a regular gym better for?</h2>
              <p>
                A traditional gym might be a better fit if you:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Want to attend group classes like spinning, yoga, or HIIT</li>
                <li>Are looking for extra facilities like a sauna, pool, or spa</li>
                <li>Are looking for the absolute lowest monthly price</li>
                <li>Enjoy the social atmosphere of a large gym</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The combination: best of both worlds</h2>
              <p>
                Some people combine a gym membership with Open Gym sessions. They use the gym for group classes and cardio,
                and Open Gym for their strength training in a quiet environment. Since Open Gym does not require a long-term
                contract, this is an easy combination to try.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Try it yourself</h2>
              <p>
                The best way to discover if Open Gym is right for you is to try it. At SculptClub, you can easily book a
                single session to experience the studio and the concept. No commitments, no pressure. Just a great workout
                in a great space.
              </p>
