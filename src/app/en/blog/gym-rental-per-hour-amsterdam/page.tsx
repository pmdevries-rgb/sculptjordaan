                As a freelance personal trainer or physiotherapist in Amsterdam, you face one major challenge: you need a professional space, but you don&apos;t want fixed monthly costs for a gym you only use part of the time. The solution? Renting a gym or training studio by the hour.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">Why hourly rental beats a fixed gym</h2>
              <p>
                Many freelance trainers start by working in regular gyms — either as hired staff or by taking out an expensive monthly membership. But that model has significant downsides:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2 list-none pl-0">
                {[
                  "Fixed monthly costs, even during slow weeks",
                  "No personal brand: clients see you working in a public gym",
                  "No control over music, temperature or other people in the space",
                  "Commission on your revenue under some arrangements",
                ].map((item) => (
                  <li key={item} className="flex items-start gap-2">
                    <span className="mt-2 w-1.5 h-1.5 rounded-full bg-brand flex-shrink-0" />
                    {item}
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                Renting a private studio by the hour solves all of this. You only pay for time you actually use. At SculptClub, that starts at <strong className="text-foreground">€12 for a 60-minute session</strong> — a fraction of what a monthly gym membership costs.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">What does gym rental per hour cost in Amsterdam?</h2>
              <p>
                Prices for renting a training space by the hour in Amsterdam vary widely. Here&apos;s an overview:

                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
              <p>
                At SculptClub there are no additional fees for equipment, wifi, or cleaning. Book online, receive your door code via WhatsApp the evening before your session, and walk straight in.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">What do you need to rent the studio?</h2>
              <p>
                Renting as a freelance trainer or physiotherapist is straightforward. You need:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2 list-none pl-0">

                    {item}
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
              <p>
                There&apos;s no lengthy selection process or waiting list. Book a trial session, see the space, and start reserving slots from there.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">What equipment is in the studio?</h2>
              <p>
                For freelance trainers and physiotherapists, the equipment in the rental studio is crucial. SculptClub offers:
              </p>
              <ul className="space-y-2 list-none pl-0">
                {[

              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">Flexible booking: when it suits you</h2>
              <p>
                The main advantage of renting a studio by the hour is flexibility. There are no fixed time slots. You book online via our system and choose exactly the times that work for your schedule and your clients. Busy week? Book more slots. Holiday? No costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                For trainers working with regular clients, discount packages are also available: save up to 23% on your hourly rate with a credit package valid for one year.
