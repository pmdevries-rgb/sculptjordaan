              <p>
                Back pain, a knee complaint, or a lingering shoulder injury that never quite heals. You want to keep training — but you&apos;re not sure how to do it safely. This is exactly where a physiotherapist who is also a personal trainer makes all the difference.
              </p>

              <h2>Why a regular personal trainer isn&apos;t always enough</h2>
              <p>
                Most personal trainers know how to build an effective programme for healthy individuals. But with an injury, chronic pain, or a rehabilitation trajectory, you need more than that. Loading incorrectly delays recovery — or makes things worse.
              </p>
              <p>
                A physiotherapist understands anatomy, knows how tissue heals, and can distinguish between pain that&apos;s acceptable during recovery and pain that&apos;s a warning signal. When that knowledge is combined with personal training, you don&apos;t just train safely — you train effectively.
              </p>

              <h2>What can a physiotherapist-personal trainer do for you?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Screen for limitations</strong> — before you start training, they map out what you can and can&apos;t do.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement analysis</strong> — faulty movement patterns are often the cause of complaints. Correcting them early prevents new injuries.</li>
                <li><strong>Tailored training programme</strong> — no generic plan, but a programme that accounts for your specific injury and goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive loading</strong> — building recovery and strength simultaneously, at a pace that works for your body.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventing relapse</strong> — once recovered, they make sure you don&apos;t repeat the same mistake.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Hamish: physiotherapist and personal trainer in Amsterdam</h2>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, <strong>Hamish</strong> holds a BSc in Physiotherapy and is also a qualified personal trainer. He works with people who can no longer train optimally due to injury or chronic complaints, as well as people who want to preventively strengthen their body.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hamish offers both 1-on-1 sessions and small group training. His approach combines physiotherapy knowledge with strength training. Rate available on request.

              <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
              <h3>Can I train with a herniated disc?</h3>
              <p>
                In many cases, yes — but with supervision and the right modifications. A physiotherapist determines which exercises are safe and how to progress loading without worsening the condition.
              </p>
              <h3>Can I train after surgery?</h3>
              <p>
                Depending on what surgery and when. Post-surgical rehabilitation is one of Hamish&apos;s specialities. He works alongside your surgeon or specialist&apos;s guidelines to build you back up safely.
              </p>
              <h3>Do you speak English?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes. Hamish is fully fluent in English — all sessions can be conducted in English.
              </p>
