              <p>
                When looking for a gym in Amsterdam, you broadly have two options: a large chain with hundreds of
                members or a small-scale private studio. Both have their pros and cons, but the differences are
                bigger than you might think. In this article, we compare the two on the most important points so
                you can make an informed decision.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Atmosphere and privacy</h2>
              <p>
                At a big box gym, you train alongside dozens to hundreds of people. That can be motivating, but
                also intimidating, especially when you are just starting out. A private gym offers an entirely
                different experience: you train in a quiet environment, often with just a few people at the same
                time. There is no crowd, no waiting and no awkward stares. You can fully focus on your workout.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Equipment and availability</h2>
              <p>
                Big box gyms have lots of equipment, but it needs to be shared among hundreds of members. During
                peak hours, it is not uncommon to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a squat rack or bench press station.
                At a private studio, equipment is always available. At SculptClub, you have access to professional
                gear, from power racks and dumbbells to cable machines, without ever having to wait.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Personal attention</h2>
              <p>
                At a large gym, you are just a number. Floor staff are mainly there for safety, not personal
                guidance. At a private studio, you get much more attention. Trainers know your name, your goals
                and your limitations. They notice when your technique drifts and correct it when needed. That
                personal approach makes all the difference, especially for beginners and people training around
                injuries.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Hygiene and maintenance</h2>
              <p>
                With hundreds of members per day, it is a challenge for large gyms to keep everything clean.
                Sweaty machines, packed changing rooms and overcrowded showers are unfortunately not the exception.
                A small-scale studio has less wear and tear and can maintain higher hygiene standards. At SculptClub,
                the studio is cleaned after every session, so you always train in a fresh space.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Flexibility and contracts</h2>
              <p>
                Large chains often work with annual contracts and cancellation periods of one to three months. That
                can be problematic if your situation changes. Private studios tend to be more flexible. At SculptClub,
                you can always cancel for free. There is no contract and no notice period. You pay for what you use,
                nothing more. That gives peace of mind and prevents you from paying for a gym you no longer visit.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Price</h2>
              <p>
                This is where the biggest difference lies. A big box gym is cheaper, sometimes starting from €20
                per month. A private studio costs more, but you also get more in return: exclusive access, personal
                attention, better hygiene and no waiting times. At SculptClub, you can book Open Gym sessions or
                choose personal training from €45 per session. It is an investment in quality over quantity.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Which one is right for you?</h2>
              <p>
                There is no universal answer. If you mainly want to exercise as cheaply as possible and do not mind
                waiting for equipment, a large chain is fine. But if you value privacy, personal attention and an
                environment that supports you, then a private gym is the better choice. SculptClub combines the
                best of both worlds: professional equipment, flexible options and no commitments.
