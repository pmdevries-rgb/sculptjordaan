                You want to try personal training but you&apos;re not sure if it&apos;s right for you.
                A free intro is the perfect way to find out — no commitment, no cost. But what
                actually happens during one of these sessions?
              </p>

              <h2>What is a free intro with a personal trainer?</h2>
              <p>
                A free intro is a first meeting between you and a personal trainer. In 30 to 45 minutes,
                you discuss your goals, your current fitness level, and what you expect from working
                together. The trainer explains how they work and whether their approach is a good fit.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, the free intro lasts 45 minutes. No preparation needed — just show up
                in your workout clothes. There&apos;s no reception desk and no waiting: you receive a
                personal door code via WhatsApp the evening before.
              </p>

              <h2>Why do personal trainers offer a free intro?</h2>
              <p>
                Good trainers know that a successful working relationship starts with the right fit.
                The intro is as much for you as it is for the trainer — they also want to know if
                you&apos;re a good match. A free session removes the barrier to taking that first step,
                without locking you into anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, all trainers work independently. They set their own rates and working
                style. The intro is always 100% free — no credit card required, no contract, no
                hidden strings.
              </p>

              <h2>What happens during the intro?</h2>
              <p>
                Every trainer has their own style, but a free intro at SculptClub typically looks
                like this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Getting to know each other:</strong> You meet the trainer and share a bit
                  about yourself. What&apos;s your fitness background? What have you tried before?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Discussing your goals:</strong> Do you want to lose weight, build muscle,
                  recover from an injury, or just get fitter? The trainer asks questions to get a
                  clear picture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Approach and method:</strong> The trainer explains how they work, which
                  methods they use, and what you can expect from the sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Studio tour:</strong> You see the space. At SculptClub, that&apos;s a private
                  studio on the Egelantiersgracht in the Jordaan — no crowds, no queues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rates and scheduling:</strong> If there&apos;s a good fit, you discuss the
                  practical side: how often, when, and what it costs. No pressure to decide right away.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How do you prepare for a free intro?</h2>
              <p>
                No extensive preparation needed. But a few things help you get more out of it:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know what you want to achieve.</strong> Think about your goals beforehand.
                  &ldquo;Getting fitter&rdquo; is a start, but &ldquo;I want to lose 10 kg in 3 months
                  and have less back pain&rdquo; gives the trainer much more to work with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Be honest about your level.</strong> Have you trained before? Do you have
                  any injuries or conditions? The more the trainer knows, the better the advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ask questions.</strong> It&apos;s a two-way conversation. Ask how the trainer
                  handles progress tracking, what happens if you want to skip a session, or what their
                  speciality is.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Arrive on time.</strong> You&apos;ll receive the door code in advance via
                  WhatsApp. Allow 5 extra minutes to find the studio and get changed.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>What questions should you ask?</h2>
              <p>A few questions worth bringing to your free intro:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What is your speciality and how does it align with my goals?</li>
                <li>What does a typical session look like?</li>
                <li>How do you track progress?</li>
                <li>What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule?</li>
                <li>How long before I start seeing results?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, you can cancel or reschedule at any time — always free, no exceptions.
              </p>

              <h2>After the intro: how do you decide?</h2>
              <p>
                You don&apos;t need to decide on the spot. Take time to think it over. A few questions
                that help:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Did the conversation feel natural?</li>
                <li>Did the trainer understand what you want to achieve?</li>
                <li>Does their approach suit you?</li>
                <li>Are you comfortable with the rate?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If the answers are yes, you&apos;re probably in the right place. If you&apos;re unsure,
                book a free intro with another trainer. You can do that too — SculptClub has five
                trainers, each with their own speciality.
              </p>
