                The Jordaan is one of Amsterdam&apos;s most popular neighbourhoods to live and work.
                But if you&apos;re looking for a gym here, you&apos;ll quickly notice the options are
                different from areas like Zuid or Oost. The neighbourhood is compact, buildings are
                small, and big fitness chains simply don&apos;t fit. That makes the Jordaan interesting
                for anyone looking for a more personal training experience.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What types of gyms are in the Jordaan?</h2>
              <p>
                In the Jordaan, you&apos;ll mainly find three types of places to train:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Big chains nearby:</strong> Basic-Fit and TrainMore have locations within
                  walking distance (Haarlemmerstraat, Rozengracht). Advantage: low entry price.
                  Disadvantage: crowded, impersonal, waiting for equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Yoga and pilates studios:</strong> The Jordaan has several yoga and pilates
                  studios. Great for flexibility and relaxation, but not an option if you want serious
                  strength training.</li>
                <li><strong>Private and boutique studios:</strong> Small, fully equipped training spaces
                  where you train alone or in a small group. More expensive per session, but you share
                  the space with nobody.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why are more people choosing a private studio?</h2>
              <p>
                The trend is clear: people don&apos;t want to stand in a crowded gym anymore. They want
                to train at their own pace, without waiting, without busy changing rooms and without the
                social pressure that many beginners feel. A private studio offers exactly that. You book
                a time slot, receive a door code and train in peace.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Strength training in the Jordaan</h2>
              <p>
                For serious strength training you need more than a treadmill and a few dumbbells. You
                need a power rack, cable machine, adjustable benches and enough free weights. Most big
                gyms have this equipment, but you share it with dozens of others. In a boutique studio
                you have all the equipment to yourself — or share with at most two other people.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Comparing costs</h2>
              <p>
                A membership at a big chain costs between €20 and €40 per month. A boutique studio
                like SculptClub works differently: you pay per session or via a flexible membership.
                Open Gym sessions start at €5.75 per visit with the Intensive plan (12 sessions per
                4 weeks for €69). The Starter plan offers 4 sessions for €29 per 4 weeks. No
                contract, no annual membership — stop whenever you want.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Personal training in the Jordaan</h2>
              <p>
                If you&apos;re looking for guidance, several trainers in the Jordaan offer personal
                training. At SculptClub, five independent trainers work with rates from €45 per
                session. The first intro is always free with no obligation. Each trainer sets their
                own rate — we charge 0% commission, so what you pay goes entirely to your trainer.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">SculptClub: private studio on the canal</h2>
              <p>
                SculptClub is located at Egelantiersgracht 424, in the heart of the Jordaan. A fully
                equipped private studio at ground level, directly from the street. Professional
                equipment from Rogue and Concept2, open daily from 06:30 to 22:00. You can train
                independently via Open Gym, choose a personal trainer or rent the studio as a
                freelance trainer.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Try it yourself</h2>
              <p>
                Curious if a private studio is right for you? Book a free trial at Open Gym or
                schedule a free intro with a personal trainer. No obligations, no membership — just
                come and see if it&apos;s for you.
