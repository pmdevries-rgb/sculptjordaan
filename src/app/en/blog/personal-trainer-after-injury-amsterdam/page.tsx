                An injury changes everything. Months without training. Muscle loss. And then
                the uncertainty: will I move like I used to? The road back doesn&apos;t start with
                training harder — it starts with training smarter. That&apos;s exactly where a
                personal trainer makes the difference.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why you can&apos;t just pick up where you left off</h2>
              <p>
                After a knee injury, back problem or shoulder surgery, your body has changed.
                Muscles have weakened, movement patterns have shifted, and compensations have
                set in. Going straight back to your old routine leads to overload or re-injury.
                A trainer rebuilds you gradually — with exercises that match your recovery stage.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What does a trainer do during recovery training?</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Restore mobility:</strong> Regain range of motion without pain first</li>
                <li><strong>Build stability:</strong> Strengthen joints and core as a foundation</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuild strength:</strong> Progressive loading — from light to your previous level</li>
                <li><strong>Correct compensations:</strong> Unlearn imbalances and avoidance patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuild confidence:</strong> Overcome the fear of moving with expert guidance</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Physiotherapist and personal trainer</h2>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, <a href="/en/find-personal-trainer" className="text-brand hover:underline">Hamish</a> works
                as a physiotherapist BSc. He combines rehabilitation knowledge with strength
                training. This means you can make the transition from physiotherapy to
                independent training under the same guidance. No more gap between rehab and sport.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other trainers at SculptClub also have experience with clients returning
                after injuries. During the <a href="/en/free-intro" className="text-brand hover:underline">free
                intro session</a> you discuss your situation and find the best match.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Private studio: no pressure, no rush</h2>
              <p>
                Recovery training requires focus and patience. In a busy gym, you feel rushed.
                At SculptClub you train in a private studio — just you and your trainer. Our
                <a href="/en/location-hours" className="text-brand hover:underline"> studio on the
                Egelantiersgracht</a> is fully equipped and you receive your door code via
                WhatsApp the evening before.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Common injuries and how training helps</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Knee (ACL, meniscus):</strong> Strengthen quadriceps and hamstrings, restore
                balance, gradually rebuild the squat pattern.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Shoulder (impingement, rotator cuff):</strong> Stabilise the shoulder blade,
