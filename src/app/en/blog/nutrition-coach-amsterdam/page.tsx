                You&apos;re training consistently, eating &ldquo;pretty healthy&rdquo; — but results aren&apos;t coming. Or you want to lose weight but can&apos;t figure out how to align your diet with your workouts. This is exactly where a nutrition coach or dietitian in Amsterdam makes the difference.
              </p>

              <h2>Nutrition coach vs. registered dietitian: what&apos;s the difference?</h2>
              <p>
                In the Netherlands, the title <strong>diëtist</strong> (dietitian) is a protected professional title. A registered dietitian holds an HBO degree (university of applied sciences) and is registered in the BIG register — the Dutch equivalent of a licensed healthcare professional. They can work with medical nutrition cases, including diabetes, kidney disease and digestive disorders, and sessions may be (partially) reimbursed by Dutch health insurance.
              </p>
              <p>
                A <strong>nutrition coach</strong> has no legally protected title. Quality varies enormously — from qualified coaches with solid backgrounds to weekend-certificate practitioners. Always check qualifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, <strong>Eva</strong> works as both a registered dietitian and personal trainer. She combines evidence-based nutrition advice with a practical training programme — something most standalone nutrition consults don&apos;t offer.
              </p>

              <h2>When do you actually need a nutrition coach?</h2>
              <p>
                Not everyone needs a dietitian right away. But in these situations, professional nutrition advice makes a real difference:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>You&apos;ve been training for months but see no progress.</strong> Nutrition is likely the missing piece.</li>
                <li><strong>You want to lose weight but can&apos;t shift it.</strong> Calorie deficits work — but only when you know how to implement them sustainably.</li>
                <li><strong>You want to build muscle.</strong> Sufficient protein at the right times is just as important as the training itself.</li>
                <li><strong>You have energy issues or slow recovery.</strong> Poor nutrition significantly delays recovery after training.</li>
                <li><strong>You have a specific condition.</strong> For PCOS, thyroid issues or digestive problems, a registered dietitian is the right person.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Nutrition and training together: why it works better</h2>
              <p>
                Most people work with a personal trainer <em>or</em> a dietitian. Rarely both. The problem: training and nutrition are inseparable. What you eat directly affects how you perform, how you recover, and how quickly you see results.
              </p>
              <p>
                When your trainer also understands nutrition — or better yet, is also a dietitian — you don&apos;t need to coordinate two separate programmes. Everything is aligned: your training load, your calorie needs, your protein intake, your recovery plan.
              </p>

              <h2>What does a nutrition consultation cost in Amsterdam?</h2>
              <p>
                A standalone session with an independent dietitian in Amsterdam costs on average €70–€110 per hour. Some supplementary health insurances cover part of this — check your policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                At SculptClub, nutrition is integrated into personal training sessions with Eva. You don&apos;t pay separately for a nutrition consultation — it&apos;s all in one session. Her rate is available on request.
              </p>
